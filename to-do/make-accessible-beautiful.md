# Make accessible beautiful

## Use dark colored text on a light colored background

Instead of using light text on a dark colored background, use dark colored text on a light colored background:

## Use icons

Donâ€™t rely on color alone. Use icons.

## Use contrast 

Rely on contrast instead of using completely different colors.
