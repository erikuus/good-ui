# Keep your line length in check

## 45-75 characters per line

For the best reading experience, make your paragraphs wide enough to fit between 45 and 75 characters per line.

## Limit the paragraph width in any context

If youâ€™re mixing paragraph text with images or other large components, you should still limit the paragraph width.
