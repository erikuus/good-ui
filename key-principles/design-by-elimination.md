# Design by elimination

To pick the best option, start by taking a guess at which one will look best, maybe 16px. Then try the values on either side (12px and 24px) for comparison. 
 
If one of the outer options looks best, do another comparison using that option as the “middle” value and make sure there’s not a better choice.
