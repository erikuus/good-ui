# Introduction

## About the gitbook

This is my **summary** of the book [**Refactoring UI**](https://www.refactoringui.com/book) by **Steve Schoger & Adam Wathan**.

In the book Steve Schoger & Adam Wathan teach how to design beautiful user interfaces using specific tactics explained from a developer's point-of-view.

In this gitbook I **summarize the key principles and tactics** I found most valuable in the book.
